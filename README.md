## Steps to get it working

This guide assumes that you've installed Raspbian OS. At the time of writing, I started with Raspbian Lite, Release date: October 30th 2021.
Please also make sure Python 3.x is installed.

`sudo raspi-config`

`sudo apt update`

```
sudo apt install \
git
python3-gpiozero
```
